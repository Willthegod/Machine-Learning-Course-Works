# USC-INF522-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning course works in INF-522 by professor M. R. Rajati

Homework 1: Classification using KNN on Vertebral Column Data Set
Explore the influence of different values of K, distance metrics and voting methods on the results

Homework 2: Linear Regression on Cycle Power Plant Data Set
Start with simple linear regession for each feature, then do multiple regression, and add nonlinear terms and interaction terms to the model. Finally compare the results of linear regression with KNN regression

Homework 3: Human Activity Time Series Classification
Feature extraction from time series:

Logistic Regression with Recursive Feature Elimination
L1-penalized logistic regression
Naive Bayesâ€™ classifier with Gaussian/Multinomial priors
Homework 4:
LASSO and Boosting for Regression on Community Crime Rate Prediction

Ridge/LASSO Regression
PCR
Boosting Tree (XGBoost)
APS Failure data Classification using Tree-Based Methods

Random Forest
Handling Class Imbalance
Logistic Model Tree by Weka
Homework 5:
Multi-class and Multi-Label Classification Using Support Vector Machines
Using one vs. all classifier to train a SVM for each of the labels using Gaussian kernels and L1-penalized

K-Means Clustering on a Multi-Class and Multi-Label Data Set
Perform K-Means Clustering on data set and determine majority labeling by reading true labels to calculate the Hamming score

Homework 6:
Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning
Examine results of different supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning methods on the same dataset.

Active Learning Using Support Vector Machines
Implement and compare Passive Learning and Active Learning using SVMs
